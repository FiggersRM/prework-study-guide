          <li>Git is used for developers to code locally while not interrupting other developers potentially working on the same code</li>
          <li>GitHub is an online repository for code and is very critical to not only editing and pulling code, but also reverting to old code in the case of a bug</li>
          <li>There are many helpful git commands that can be used in the CLI to help developers:</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currerntly working on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch under the new name and switches to it</li>
          <li>git pull: Pulls the most recent form of code from the online repository</li>
          <li>git add: Stages a branch of code to prepare it to commit</li>
          <li>git commit -m: commits the staged code to a pull request to GitHub</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer exectues code in a script</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures that are used to test if an expression returns true or not</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse by taking arguments</li>
          <li>Loops and conditional statements help us utilize control flow so that code isn't interrupted</li>
          <li>Arrays are a group of data stored in a single variable</li>
          <li>Each part of an array is assigned an index within the defined variable, starting at 0</li>
          <li>for loops can be used to efficiently work through an array of data</li>
          <li>Functions are a set of instructions which tell the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>functions do not automatically execute when a script is run, but must be defined and called upon</li>
          <li>A function is defined using a declaration, and executed when the definition is typed and followed by parenthesis</li>
