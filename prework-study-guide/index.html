          <li>Git is used for developers to code locally while not interrupting other developers potentially working on the same code</li>
          <li>GitHub is an online repository for code and is very critical to not only editing and pulling code, but also reverting to old code in the case of a bug</li>
          <li>There are many helpful git commands that can be used in the CLI to help developers:</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currerntly working on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch under the new name and switches to it</li>
          <li>git pull: Pulls the most recent form of code from the online repository</li>
          <li>git add: Stages a branch of code to prepare it to commit</li>
          <li>git commit -m: commits the staged code to a pull request to GitHub</li>
